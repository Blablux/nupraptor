#nupraptor

**nupraptor** is a simple project aimed at exporting your xbmc/kodi movies/tvshows database to an online service like google sheets.

##What it does right now
Not much at the moment, it's still a work in progress...

##What it needs right now
Not much either.  
Though it relies on the single file export of xbmc/kodi to do the extraction, and uses XSLT to extract and convert the database into CSV.

##Goals
At its best, it should be able to convert any given database, and export it to an online service.
It aims to be easily customisable, because everyone has different needs.
For the moment, I only plan to send to google sheets (and use CSV as a conversion format). Feel free to drop a commit to add another service.
