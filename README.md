#Nupraptor

Nupraptor is a collection of small shell scripts that do various things.

The scripts are more a sandbox for me to (re)learn Shell programming.

## Scripts list
- `kodidb.sh` is a script that exports a [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) database to
  two csv files, one for movies and one for TV shows.  
  This script can take two parameters :
  - The database path (_required_)
  - The output directory (_optional, defaults to script directory_)

## Side Note

Nupraptor is the guardian of the pillar of _Mind_ and a NPC from the video
games serie [Legacy of Kain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain).
